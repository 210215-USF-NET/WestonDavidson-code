# week 1 content review
- notes taken are on practice questions/categories I don't feel completely confident in

# collections
- IEnumerable
    - IEnumerable interface exposes an enumerator, which supports simple iteration of a non-generic/generic collection
    - IEnumarable is also the root interface of the collections hierarchy

# out keyword
- allows one to send a parameter to a method call which does not yet have a value assigned to it
- this means the method will return the value of the out after processing

# ref keyword
- passes a direct reference in a parameter instead of just the value
- by default, c# just passes the value but not the reference!

# arrange, act, assert

- covariance - anything that can go UP to a certain class
- contravariance - anything that can go DOWN to a certain class
- invariance - nothing can go up or down to a certain class


- is operator for runtime, typeof operator for compile time
