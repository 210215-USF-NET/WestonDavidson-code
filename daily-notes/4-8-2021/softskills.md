## soft skill qs
1. tell me about yourself (tmay)
    - this is the most well practiced answer
    - pro tip: write this down. have a written document of your tmay spiel
        - even if that document isn't memorized, at the very least you have some sort of structure of how to talk about yourself without rambling
    - parts of this answer:
        1. introduce yourself by stating full name
            - ex: hello, my name is weston davidson
        1. Educational background:
            - I graduated with a bachelors degree in information technology from Daytona State college, and served as resident webmaster for the student newspaper throughout the duration of my degree
            - note: don't have to talk about year of graduation, don't wanna seem too nooby
            - if degree is completely unrelated to field, maybe don't mention it
            - mention honors, awards, relevant extracirricular activities
        1. projects / work experience
            - if you have a lot of experience, you may want to bring this up
            - Ex: as an undergraduate, I provided freelance services to small business clients to create websites that met their business requirements, which are displayed on my portfolio website
        1. Tech stack
            - talk about the technologies you've learned with Revature
            - recommend going back-front or front-back as far as technologies used, devops, sdlc, maybe testing
            - talk about projects created with tech stack!! So revature projects. talk about p2, p3
            - example: while working in revature, I've gained experience with numerous backend technologies, lncluding multiple sql dialects such as postgresql for storage, leveraging the .net platform to write programs in csharp, utilizing frameworks such as ASP.NET to create web applications. Furthermore, within the realm of front-end technologies, I am adept in HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and typescript. I am also familiar with Angular to design single page applications. I can also deploy my application via a ci/cd pipeline withing azure devops, and have managed multiple aspects of the azure platform, including azure app services.
            With these technologies I've been able to create a total of 3 projects while working with revature. The most prominent being my p3 where I was chosen as the TL, where I was responsible for etc. etc.
