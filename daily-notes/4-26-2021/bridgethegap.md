# SWOT
- swot helps assess where life/careers can go
- ask questions about each four areas being examined
- don't only limit current strengths that are currently active, also dormant

- good at naturally, what do other people see, values and ethics set you apart, etc.

- weaknesses
- bad habits, weaknesses, what can improve, most likely to avoid

- opportunities
    - state of the economy, new technology, needs that are not being filled, etc.
    - look at strengths, ask if they open opportunities

- threats
    - weaknesses that affect goals, professional standards, learning requirements


- convert weaknesses and threats into strengths and opportunities

- threats are external and not necessarily in your control
