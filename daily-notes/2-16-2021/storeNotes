P0 Notes
-   Have a theme! Make your store unique.

Example Application
-   Marielle is using a whiteboard to create a wireframe to sketch out her Application
-   She lists the functionality requirements
-   She has the methods she wants, so how will she go about designing her application?
-   Think about design before implementation or anything else
-   Consider things like classes, interfaces that will be implemented based on what sort of things will be needed (relationships, is-a, has-a relationships, properties etc.)
-   When you're prototyping, try to limit your properties. You want to lay groundwork more than you want to create full implementation. Full implmementation can come later.
-   Keep your models lean - don't add unnecessary properties
-   This is also a test of scalability once you want to add additional properties or elements

Classlib can be used as a class library which your primary application references
