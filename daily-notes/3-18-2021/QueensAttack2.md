- square chess board
- one queen, multiple obstacles
- figure out how many squares the queen can attack


each square is referenced by a tuple to describe row and column where square is located



- int n: the number of rows and columns in the board
- nt k: the number of obstacles on the board
- int r_q: the row number of the queen's position
- int c_q: the column number of the queen's position
- int obstacles[k][2]: each element is an array of  integers, the row and column of an obstacle


The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the length of the board's sides and the number of obstacles.
The next line contains two space-separated integers  and , the queen's row and column position.
Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers  and , the row and column position of obstacle[i].
